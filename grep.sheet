  Useful Options
  ==============
  -h:   suppress file names in output
  -w:   restrict search to whole words only
  -c:   displays count of matching lines in each file, not the lines themselves

  -i:   ignore case
  -l:   list only file names containing matching lines
  -n:   precede each line with the line number where it was found
  -v:   display all lines NOT matching pattern
